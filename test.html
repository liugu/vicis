                              What is your refund and cancellation policy?

                            <span class="sf-answer">
                              We require a full payment on the agreed quote at the time of placing an
                              order.
                              <br />
                              In the event of cancellation, your payment is refundable minus 15% cancellation
                              fee provided Sweet Lane is notified at least three (3) days prior to the
                              event. There is no payment refund on orders canceled within three (3) days
                              of the event.
                              <br />
                              The reasoning behind this policy is because we must order ingredients
                              or create components in advance, in addition to labor that has already
                              been expended in the preparation of any special order. Short notice cancellations
                              (within 3 days) are also not given a refund because our production calendar
                              fills up quickly and is on a first-come, first-served basis. Therefore,
                              if you cancel, your order has taken up production time that could have
                              otherwise been given to another customer, so we lose both orders.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                              Due to the tedious, handcrafted nature of our products, we would not be
                              able to provide any refunds on any customized orders.
                              <br />
                              Cake flavor and texture is subjective. Refunds requested due to flavor
                              or texture after cake has been accepted and picked up will not be honored.
                              <br />
                              <br />
                              Refunds are only provided under the following circumstances:
                              <br />
                              When your cake is delivered, you will be asked to inspect the cake for
                              any obvious damage. In the event that you received a damaged cake, please
                              notify the delivery team immediately. You will be issued a full refund
                              via original purchase method once we receive the original cake back (in
                              its entirety). We reserve the final right to determine if a cake is actually
                              faulty or damaged. Delivery fees are non-refundable. No other claims apart
                              from the 100% refund will be tenable.

                              All our cakes are deliciously moist and baked fresh, from scratch; no

                              never sacrificed. Whether it's butter from Germany, rich, pure Italian
                              chocolate, Madagascar vanilla beans and extracts, Vietnamese cinnamon powder
                              or Japanese matcha powder, you will savor each and every crumb.

                              As each cake is unique, we do not have a set price list. All cakes are
                              priced individually for each client based on the size, complexity of the
                              design, hours of craftwork and materials used. Due to the nature of our
                              work and the extra time and attention given to each of our creations, we
                              require a minimum of Dhs 475 for each custom cake.

                              If the quote we provided is not within your budget, knowing how much money
                              you want to spend will help us match your theme or suggest modifications
                              or options to create similar looking cake that will fit your budget. It
                              will help us determine what to design for you and how much details we need
                              to include to get to your finished product.

                              cake. Sugar flowers and figurines are all hand crafted items, so we need
                              plenty of time to create all the little details on your cake. Wedding cakes
                              require four weeks notice.
